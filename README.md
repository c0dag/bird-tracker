# bird-tracker
This was my first moderately complex projectâ€”a bird tracker utilizing computer vision (OpenCV) to monitor and log bird activity outside my window. By comparing frames, the program can identify distinct pixels in the video feed and is optimized (to some extent) to recognize only flying birds. In the end, with the collected data, I was able to create a graph showing the number of birds over time and observe their migratory time preferences.
